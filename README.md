### Charts

season chart:

The Season Chart for Air Quality Index (AQI) allows users to analyze and compare the air quality trends across different seasons, with the option to filter the data by state. By visualizing the AQI data over various seasons, users can gain insights into seasonal variations in air quality and identify patterns or trends.
